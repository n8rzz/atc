# Tools

#### Node
You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run any of the commands below.

#### Project Installation

After you have node installed, navigate to the project folder and run `npm install && npm run build`.  This will install the project dependencies and run the build tasks for the css and javascript.

#### Folder Structure
Folders are organized with the following main folders:
```
- assets
- documentation
- src
- test
- tools
index.html
Gulpfile.js
```

* `assets/`

This is where the code that runs the application lives. This folder also contains two folders that are generated as a result of build commands: `style` and `scripts`.  _Any changes made to files in these two folders will be overwritten the next time a build command is run.  If you need to edit CSS or Javascript files, please edit the files in the `src` folder_.  If you are a content creator, one who is adding Airports, Airlines or Aircraft, your `.json`/`.geojson` files should be added here just as they always have been.

* `src/`

The application's CSS and Javascript source files.  If you are developing Javascript or CSS, the files you want to edit live in this folder.

* `test/`

Application test files.  The folder structure here should mirror that of the `src` folder.  For example, if you want to write some tests for the `src/assets/scripts/math/circle.js` file, it should live in `test/math/circle.spec.js`.  If you are writing any new tests, they should go here.  Any test file should have a `**/*.spec.js` file extension.  Test files are run by folder then globbing pattern, so if you have a support file it should have just a `.js` extension.  Testing is run via [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) with coverage reporting generated by [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc).  There are full HTML coverage reports available to view in the `coverage/lcov-report` folder.  

* `tools/`

Any `gulp` task is defined in one of the files in this folder.

* `Gulpfile.js`

This is the entry point for all `gulp` tasks.  There should never be a process defined in this file, just references to a tasks defined in the `tools/tasks` folder.  The only exception to this is for root tasks like `build`, `lint`, `watch`, etc.  These root tasks are just wrappers for a collections of other tasks.

#### NPM Commands
Available `npm` commands:
* `npm run start` Will spool up a small web server using the `http-server` package.  Once the server successfully starts, you can view the app at localhost:3003 in your web browser.

* `npm run build` _alias for_ `gulp dist && npm run test`.

* `npm run test` Will run the `ava` test suite and output a coverage report in the terminal window.

* `npm run report` Will generate a coverage report from the last test run.  If only a specific subset of files was tested, the coverage report will reflect that.  ex: `npm run test -- test/math/` will run all the tests in the `test/math/` directory and generate coverage for only the files tested.  Any other file that is not related to the files being tested will be ignored in the coverage report.

* `npm run coverage` Runs the entire test suite _and_ generates a coverage report.

#### Gulp commands
All the `gulp` commands defined in the Gulpfile are combined tasks, meaning they actually call other tasks defined in the `tools/tasks` folder.  The main `gulp` commands defined in this file are:

* `gulp build` Concat, minify autoprefix CSS to `assets/styles/main.min.css` with sourcemaps, transpile and browserify javascript to `assets/scripts/bundle.js` with sourcemaps


* `gulp dist` Everything `gulp build` does plus run `eslint` and output a per-file report of errors and warnings.

* gulp watch Watches for changes for css and javascript files and runs an associated compilation task if a change is detected.
