/**
 * This class is responsible for taking the content of the `$commandInput` and parsing it
 * out into commands and arguments.
 *
 * Everything this class needs comes in as a single string provided by `InputController.input_run()`.
 * ex:
 * - `timewarp 50`
 * - `AA777 fh 0270 d 050 sp 200`
 * - `AA777 hold dumba left 2min`
 *
 * **Differentiation of commands and arguments is determinied by splitting the string on an empty space. This
 * is very important, so legacy commands did not have spaces between the command and argument. With this
 * implementation _every_ command shall have a space between itself and it's arguments.**
 *
 * Commands are broken out into two categories: `System` and `Transmit`.
 * - System commands are zero or single argument commands that are used for interacting with the app
 *   itslef. Things like `timewarp` or `tutorial` are examples of system commands.
 *
 * - Transmit commands are instructions meant for a specific aircraft within the controlled airspace.
 *   These commands can have zero to many arguments, depending on the command. Some examples of transmit
 *   commands are `to`, `taxi`, `hold`.
 *
 * Commands go through a lifecycle as they move from raw to parsed:
 * - user types command and presses enter
 * - command string is captured via input value, then passed as an argument to this class
 * - determine if command string is a `System Command` or `Transmit`
 * - creation of `CommandModel` objects for each command/argment group found
 * - validate command arguments (number of arguments and data type)
 * - parse command arguments
 *
 * All available commands are defined in the `commandMap`. Two terms of note are alias and root command.
 * We would call the `takeoff` command a root command and `to` and `cto` alises. The root command is the
 * one that shares the same key as the command definition which gives us the correct validator and parser.
 * The root command is also what the `AircraftInstanceModel` is expecting when it receives commands
 * from the `InputController`.
